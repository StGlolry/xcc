A C/C++ code obfuscator based on llvm/clang technology, make obfuscating 
code in C/C++/OBJC/Others supported by llvm tech easily, obfuscating is not 
absolute secure, but can make RE and code stolen harder.

In theory, it should support all mainstream versions(linux/mac/win, x86/x64/arm),
but now it's only tested on windows now.

There are some obfuscators, but I'd like to make this one strongest someday.

[1] Limitations

only limited stragies implemented.

[2] plan:

linux/macos and non-x86 target support when I've spare time.

[3] Why?

Is vmp enough?

No, obfuscation at binary level has some limitations and so do at src level, so both
techs should be considered in your projects.

Long long ago when I met kanxue, I proposed a plan but I never started it for various
reasons, and recently I hear scz have some interest on the project, I started immediately!

NB, It's for fun only, it's a hack on a weekend, don't blame me for not working hard!

[4] OpenSource or not?

Not now, maybe in the future.

[5] Can I join?

Sure, but now you'd have some contributions to view the source-code, you can do some develop task
or contribute valuable obfuscating codes or engines you wrote before. however you can contact me
at humeafo@gmail.com.
